### App to import DevEx metrics of different kind.

### Running the import

- Specify repos you're interested in [app.importConfig.ts](src/app.importConfig.ts) (currently only GitHub is
  supported).
- Specify GitHub tokens for import configs in the way you prefer (e.g. via environment variables).
- Run the ```npm run docker-import:start``` command to start preconfigured Postgres and Grafana, build and run the importer and
  listen for its logs.

> ðŸ’¡ People use tools in diverse ways, and the importer logic may not always account for every scenario. Time zones, Git
> history rewrites, and occasional quirks in GitHub APIs (like missing commit data for pull requests, as
> in
> [this example](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/637)) can all impact data consistency.
>
> To manage this, the [PullRequest.ts](src/MetricsDB/entities/PullRequest.ts) class includes a `validateDataIntegrity`
> method.
> Validation errors are logged during
> import, and while invalid pull requests are stored in the database, theyâ€™re excluded from Grafana panels.
>
> I recommend carefully reviewing this data to spot any irregularities.
>
> This feature is also could be helpful if youâ€™re building your own importer for the SCM system of your need (and weâ€™d
> love your
> contributions!).

### Configuring dev environment

- Install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org) on your machine
- Run `npm i` from the repo root directory
- Run `npm run docker:init` to start preconfigured Postgres and Grafana.
- Create `.env` and copy values from [docker-compose.dev.yml](assets/docker-compose.dev.yml) into it.
- Specify repos you're interested in [app.importConfig.ts](src/app.importConfig.ts) (currently only GitHub is
  supported).
- Run ```npm run start``` to initiate the import of the data on your local machine

### Running unit tests

- Easy as ```npm run test```.
- Since I'm a lazy guy, tests use snapshots. You can update them by running ```npm run test:update-snapshots```

### Managing database structure

- This project uses [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/migrations) for database migrations. After modifying the schema, you
  can apply migrations using
  ```npm run migration:generate ./src/MetricsDB/migrations/<MIGRATION NAME>```
- Migrations are automatically applied when the app starts, so no manual intervention is typically needed.
- You can manage migrations process on your own with `npm run migration:run` and `npm run migration:revert` commands.
